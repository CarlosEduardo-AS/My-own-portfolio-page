# My-own-portfolio-page
I’ve made some good progress here. I started building my portfolio page using HTML and CSS. So far, I’ve designed the structure and layout, focusing on creating a clean and responsive interface. I plan to add JavaScript soon to make the website more interactive, and I also intend to improve some parts of the HTML and CSS to make the design even better.

This is my first real project using these technologies, and it’s helping me a lot to practice and understand how web development works in real-world scenarios. I’m really excited to keep learning, improving my skills, and adding new features to this project as I go.
